# Kd-Trees

Wrote a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square (all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) used a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point)
